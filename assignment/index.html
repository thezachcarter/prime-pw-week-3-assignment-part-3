        <li>In question 9 of part three, I couldn't think of an elegant way
        of displaying the number of boxes filled in the console. How would you
        go about doing that?</li>
        <li>I encountered an issue with loops going infinite or the page not
        loading when I used + or - in the code. I was easily able to fix
        the issues by using += or -= instead, but I don't understand why that
        works. Could you explain that to me?</li>
      </ol>
